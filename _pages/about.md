I am a PhD-track student in Data and AI at Institut Polytechnique de Paris. I am fortunate to be advised by [Aymeric Dieuleveut](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~aymeric.dieuleveut/) and [Michael I. Jordan](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jordan) on questions at the intersection of optimization, statistics, and machine learning.

My research studies algorithmic principles for large-scale federated learning, with a focus on communication-efficient optimization and uncertainty quantification. I am particularly interested in randomized compression schemes, conformal prediction, and statistically principled calibration methods that remain tractable in distributed environments.

Before joining IP Paris, I completed a B.S. in Mathematics and Information Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and spent time at EPFL, CMAP, and CUHK working on projects in personalized federated learning and differential privacy.
